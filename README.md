# Kubernetes Multi-Log Dashboard

A web-based dashboard for monitoring logs from multiple Kubernetes pods and containers in real-time. This tool allows you to open up to 4 separate log windows, each streaming logs from a specific pod and container, with proper isolation between streams.

## Features

- **Real-Time Log Streaming**: View logs from Kubernetes pods and containers in real-time.
- **Multiple Log Windows**: Open up to 4 log windows simultaneously, each streaming logs from a different container.
- **Namespace Filtering**: Load pods from a specific namespace.
- **Search Logs**: Filter logs in each window using a search input.
- **Dynamic Container Selection**: Prevents selecting the same container in multiple windows.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure you have access to a running Kubernetes cluster.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required to run the Flask backend.
- **kubectl**: Ensure `kubectl` is configured to access your Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esysc/kube-dashboard.git
   cd kube-dashboard
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Flask server
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
